Encapsulation: a standard class where data are private and methods are public
	Netbanking: account>> acc holder, number, balance
	Gpay	  : bank, google account
	Billing	  : stock>> name, quantity, price
	

Constructor:
	A method>> modifier returntype name(param)
		name of the method can be anything
		will execute when we call manually
	Constructor/ special method>> modifier name(param)
		name of contructor should same as Classname
		will execute automatically when the object created for the class	
	purpose:
		to initialize class properties
		execute the important operations before other could perform:
			GPAY: bill pay, transfer,reacharge
				login via pin>> they could have written in constructor
	types:
		default>> no parameters
		parameterized>> with parameters

		
Polymorphsim:
  Overloading/ static/ compile time:
  	within a class/ in single class itself
	same name for multiple blocks
	parameters has to be different between each block by count, order and type
		constructor, method
  Overriding/ dynamic/ run time:
  	between two classes which involved in inheritance process
  	parameters of those two methods from different class should be same
  	

Inheritance: object reusability
	deriving/ copying one resource's property to another
	
	super/parent/base>>those who providing property to some one
	child/derived	 >>those who receives/ derive the property from some one
	
	Components those involves in inheritance process
		class, interface
	
	keywords:
		derivedclass extends baseclass
		derivedinterface extends baseinterface
		derivedclass implements interface
	
	types:
		single
		multilevel
		hierarchy
		multiple
		hybrid
